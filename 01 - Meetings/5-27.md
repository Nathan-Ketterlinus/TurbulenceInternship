# 🚀 Meeting -> 

funded by a grant by the NSF

we might get emails from people asking if we're supported by a grant, we need to reply yes!

as a group, we're meeting once a week (Tuesday @ 1:00pm)
- split into 2 groups, each group reports their progress
- I'm with Matthew and Dean! (Team 2)
	- meet with your group at least once a week

we've had a folder shared with us
- has initial steps from Chenyue
- we're going to apply the method from the research paper to our own equation!
- talk between groups to double check our work!
	- ie ask the other team before Tian

we should have DeepXCE ready to go today!

by next week, we need to go over the paper
- don't try to fully understand it, but get a gist from the abstract and introduction

- use deep learning and use equations
	- get the numerical results from page 15
	- similar graphs, not 1 to 1 ofc

before each meeting, we're expected to have a report ready
- generate a new folder in Chenyue's folder for our report each week!
- can be a very informal doc lol
- tell what we've done this week, and whats the progress

TASKS THIS WEEK
- read the paper
- get the idea

Team 1 working on the equation:
- Simplified Bardina Equation
Team 2 working on the equation:
- Navier Stokes Alpha Equation

### Simplified Bardina Equation
- Has a paper in the shared folder that explains it
- go to the paper and find the equation
- $\phi$ on page 4

this maybe?

next week, give a presentation on what each term represents

### Navier Stokes Alpha Equation
- "slightly easier"
- chenyue already has some work on it in the folder
	- she's already got initial code setup!
	- there should be a pptx explaining each term in there
	- do independent research in tandem with this!
- go to each folder for some important info

next Tuesday, need to read the paper, get the idea, THEN get an idea on what our task is
- use deep learning to study the equations we're given
- know what equation we're studying in detail (ie what does each term represent)
	- so that later we can apply the formula in code

Tian has the big picture, but we should explore on our own first!!

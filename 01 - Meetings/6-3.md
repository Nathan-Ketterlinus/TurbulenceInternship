# 🚀 Meeting -> 

review of reports:
### Team 1:
u is a vector
	($u = <u_{1}, u_{2},u_{3}>$)
	$\nabla= <\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}>$
		$u \cdot \nabla = <\frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial u_{3}}{\partial z}>$

we need to write *explicitly* what each product means
$\nu \neq v$

at the end of the project, we need a graph
- rate of convergence we dont require
- we just need a trend of convergence

the assignment for this week:
2 parts:
- ???
- go over assigned paper (Nudging NN AntilPrice)
	- go over intro and numerical part (dont worry about proofs)
	- write a summary of that paper in our next report
	- eventually we will write

### Team 2:
task for following week:
2 things:
1. read and summarize [[Nudging_NN_AntilPrice.pdf]]
	1. especially the numerical parts
	2. summarize in report
	3. we are mimic-ing their work this summer, so understand it
2. try to understand how neural network and deep learning works, make a slide presentation on it.
	1. could be used in conference talks later
	2. cannot present stuff from other people, word it yourself!

work with each other!!
we can meet as a group of 5 to discuss the two tasks!

no meeting next week, but meeting the following week
